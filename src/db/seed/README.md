# 🏈 Pick'em Leagues Seeding Tool

This tool creates realistic test data for Pick'em leagues across different phases of a football season. It's designed to help you test your application with various scenarios.

> **📖 For a complete overview of seeding strategies, see [SEEDING_STRATEGY.md](./SEEDING_STRATEGY.md)**

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

```bash
# 1. Set up your database
npm run db:migrate

# 2. Create base data (if needed)
npm run db:seed:base

# 3. Seed pick'em leagues
npm run db:seed:pickem -- inSeason --leagues 2 --users 5
```

That's it! You now have realistic test data to work with.

## 🎯 What This Tool Does

### Mock Data Seeding (This Tool)

- **Purpose**: Generate fictional test data for development and testing
- **Data Source**: Completely generated/mock data
- **Use Case**: Development, unit testing, feature development, demos
- **Speed**: Fast, no external dependencies
- **Command**: `npm run db:seed:pickem`

### Alternative: Real Data Seeding (ESPN Integration)

- **Purpose**: Populate database with actual ESPN data
- **Data Source**: ESPN APIs via cron jobs
- **Use Case**: Production, integration testing, real data scenarios
- **Speed**: Slower, depends on ESPN API availability
- **Command**: `npm run db:seed`

**Choose mock data seeding for most development work. Use real data seeding only when you need to test with actual ESPN data.**

> **💡 Tip**: If you see npm warnings about argument parsing, you can also run the CLI directly: `npx tsx src/db/seed/pickemLeagues.cli.ts <phase> [options]`

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before running the **mock data seeding tool**, ensure you have:

1. **Database setup**: Run migrations first

   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

2. **Required base data**: The tool needs:
   - League types (Pick'em)
   - Sport leagues (NFL)
   - Seasons
   - Phase templates

### Setting up Base Data

If you encounter "Required base data not found" errors, you can set up minimal base data using:

```bash
npm run db:seed:base
```

This will create the minimum required data for the pick'em seeding to work.

## 🚀 Basic Usage

### Simple Commands

```bash
# Seed offseason data (completed season)
npm run db:seed:pickem -- offseason

# Seed preseason data (upcoming season)
npm run db:seed:pickem -- preseason

# Seed in-season data (week 5 of current season)
npm run db:seed:pickem -- inSeason

# Seed end-of-season data (just finished)
npm run db:seed:pickem -- endSeason
```

### With Custom Options

```bash
# Custom week simulation (in-season only)
npm run db:seed:pickem -- inSeason --week 7

# Multiple leagues with custom user count
npm run db:seed:pickem -- inSeason --leagues 4 --users 8

# Specific league types
npm run db:seed:pickem -- preseason --ats --straight-up

# Combine options
npm run db:seed:pickem -- inSeason --week 7 --leagues 3 --users 12 --ats
```

## ⚙️ Advanced Features

### 👑 Commissioner User Feature

Designate a specific user as the commissioner of all generated leagues. This is useful for testing purposes, allowing you to log in with a known user ID and see all the seeded data.

```bash
# Make user "my-test-user" the commissioner of all leagues
npm run db:seed:pickem -- inSeason --commissioner GBaJwUaIsmOIpMXlA0KGX9OzmnSd3Ygg --leagues 2 --users 5

# Use an existing user ID from your database
npm run db:seed:pickem -- preseason --commissioner existing-user-123 --leagues 1 --users 3
```

**How it Works:**

- **New User**: If the commissioner user ID doesn't exist, a new user will be created with that ID
- **Existing User**: If the commissioner user ID already exists, it will be used as-is (no duplicate creation)
- **Commissioner Role**: The specified user becomes the commissioner of ALL generated leagues
- **User Count**: The commissioner user counts toward the total users per league

### 🧹 Data Cleanup Feature

Clean up existing pick'em data before seeding new data. This ensures a clean slate for each scenario and prevents data conflicts.

```bash
# Clean up existing data and seed new preseason data
npm run db:seed:pickem -- preseason --cleanup --leagues 2 --users 5

# Clean up and seed with commissioner user
npm run db:seed:pickem -- inSeason --cleanup --commissioner my-user --leagues 1 --users 3
```

**What Gets Cleaned Up:**
The cleanup process removes all pick'em related data in the correct order:

1. **Picks** (depends on users, events, teams, leagues)
2. **Live Scores & Outcomes** (depend on events)
3. **Events** (depend on phases, teams)
4. **League Members** (depend on leagues, users)
5. **Leagues** (depend on league types, phase templates)
6. **Phases** (depend on seasons, phase templates)
7. **Teams** (depend on sport leagues)
8. **Users** (preserves commissioner if specified)

**Commissioner User Preservation:**
When using `--cleanup` with `--commissioner`, the cleanup process will:

- Delete all other users
- Preserve the specified commissioner user
- Reuse the existing commissioner user for the new leagues

This allows you to maintain a consistent test user across different scenarios.

## 📊 What Data Gets Generated

### Teams (12 total)

- Detroit Lions, Chicago Bears, Philadelphia Eagles, etc.
- Each team has proper location and abbreviation

### Phases (10 total)

- One phase per week (Week 1 through Week 10)
- Each phase represents a single NFL week
- Each phase is linked to its corresponding phase template (Week 1, Week 2, etc.)
- **Pick lock time**: Set to noon on the second-to-last day of each phase
- Proper start/end dates (7 days per phase)
- Sequential numbering (1-10)

### Games (60 total)

- 6 games per week × 10 weeks
- Each game is assigned to its corresponding week phase
- **All games in a phase happen on the same day** (second-to-last day of the phase)
- Games are scheduled at 12 PM, 1 PM, 2 PM, etc. on that day
- Realistic scheduling (no team plays twice in same week)
- Dynamic start times based on phase

### Users & Leagues

- Configurable number of users per league
- Mix of ATS and Straight Up leagues
- League settings follow `PickEmLeagueSettingsSchema`:
  - `picksPerPhase`: Number of picks per week (default: 3)
  - `pickType`: Either "spread" (ATS) or "straight-up"
- League members with proper roles (commissioner/member)

### Picks & Results

- **Pick Count**: Each user makes exactly 3 picks per week (configurable)
- **Pick Selection**: Randomly selects 3 games from each week's 6 games
- **Team Selection**: Randomly picks one of the two teams actually playing in each selected game
- **Pick Generation**: Based on phase and week logic
- **Spread Handling**: For ATS leagues, picks include the correct spread for the selected team
- **Realistic Scores**: For completed games
- **Live Scores**: For in-progress games

### Odds & Spreads

- **Odds Generation**: Realistic NFL odds generated for all events
- **Spreads**: Range from -14 to +14, only whole numbers or .5 (e.g., -3, -3.5, +7, +7.5)
- **Moneylines**: Range from -300 to +300 (realistic NFL moneylines)
- **Totals**: Range from 35.0 to 55.0 (typical NFL game totals)
- **ATS Picks**: Include the correct spread for the selected team
- **Straight Up Picks**: No spread included (null value)

## 🎭 Season Phases Explained

### Common Workflows

**For New Developers:**

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed:base
npm run db:seed:pickem -- inSeason --leagues 2 --users 5
```

**For Feature Development:**

```bash
npm run db:seed:pickem -- preseason --leagues 1 --users 3
```

**For Testing with Known User:**

```bash
npm run db:seed:pickem -- inSeason --commissioner my-test-user --leagues 2 --users 5
```

**For Clean Testing (Recommended):**

```bash
npm run db:seed:pickem -- preseason --cleanup --commissioner my-test-user --leagues 1 --users 3
```

**Important**: When using npm scripts, you must use the `--` separator before your arguments to ensure they are properly passed to the CLI tool.

**For Production Setup:**

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed  # Requires ESPN API credentials
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Required base data not found"

For mock data seeding, run:

```bash
npm run db:seed:base
```

For real data seeding, run:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

### Database connection issues

Ensure your database is running and environment variables are set correctly.

### Type errors

Make sure you're using the latest version of the codebase and all dependencies are installed.
