## Description

As a league member, I should be able to leave a league I am a part of. This provides users with the autonomy to manage their participation in leagues. It also includes safeguards to ensure league continuity, such as requiring a commissioner to designate a replacement before leaving and handling the deletion of single-member leagues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A league member can choose to leave a league.
- [ ] A member can only leave a league when it is not in-season.
- [ ] If a commissioner attempts to leave a league with other members
- [ ] they must designate at least one other commissioner before they can leave.
- [ ] If a member is the only person in a league and they leave
- [ ] the league is deleted.
- [ ] Before leaving a single-member league
- [ ] the user is warned that the league will be deleted.
