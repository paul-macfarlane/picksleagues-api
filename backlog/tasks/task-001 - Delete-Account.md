## Description

This task is to create an API endpoint for account deletion. The endpoint will handle all the business logic and data modifications required to securely remove a user from the system. It will ensure that all personally identifiable information is erased while maintaining the integrity of historical, anonymized data.
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] API provides an endpoint to delete a user account.
- [ ] The endpoint requires authentication to ensure a user can only delete their own account.
- [ ] Upon successful deletion
- [ ] the user's PII is permanently removed from the database.
- [ ] The user's authentication credentials are invalidated
- [ ] preventing future logins.
- [ ] All historical records (e.g.
- [ ] picks
- [ ] standings) associated with the user are anonymized.
- [ ] If the user is the sole member of a league
- [ ] that league is deleted.
- [ ] The API returns an error if a user tries to delete their account while being the sole commissioner of a league with other members.
