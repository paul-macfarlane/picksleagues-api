## Description

As a league commissioner, I need the ability to remove members from a league. This is essential for managing league membership, for example, if a member no longer wishes to participate. To prevent accidental data loss, I should be warned of the consequences before finalizing the removal.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A league commissioner can initiate the removal of a league member.
- [ ] Before confirming the removal
- [ ] the commissioner is shown a warning about the consequences.
- [ ] A member can only be removed from a league when the league is not in season.
- [ ] When a member is removed
- [ ] their historical pick and standings data is retained.
- [ ] A commissioner cannot remove themselves from the league using this feature.
