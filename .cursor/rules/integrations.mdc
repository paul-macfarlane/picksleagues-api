- Encapsulate each external API in an `@injectable` service (e.g., `EspnService`).
- Perform all network I/O here; translate external data to internal shapes.
- Make services mockable in tests; avoid direct calls from services without an abstraction.
- No database access in integrations; return data to feature services for persistence.
