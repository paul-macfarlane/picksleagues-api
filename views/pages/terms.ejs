  <p>By accessing or using PicksLeagues (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

  <h2>2. Our Service</h2>
  <p>PicksLeagues lets you create and join private leagues, make weekly picks for sporting events, view standings, and compete with friends. Scores, schedules, and odds may be sourced from third parties and are provided for entertainment and informational purposes only.</p>

  <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may use the Service only with the consent of a parent or guardian.</p>

  <h2>4. Accounts & Security</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for your account, including safeguarding your login credentials and for all activity under your account. Provide accurate information and keep it up to date. Notify us promptly of any suspected unauthorized use.</p>

  <h2>5. Leagues, Picks, and Visibility</h2>
  <p>League names, member usernames, picks, and standings are visible to other members of the same league. Commissioners may manage league settings and membership. Attempting to bypass pick lock times or manipulate results is prohibited.</p>

  <h2>6. Fair Play and Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to: (a) cheat or use automated tools or bots; (b) interfere with the Service or other users; (c) scrape or harvest data; (d) attempt to circumvent technical restrictions; (e) harass, threaten, or impersonate others; or (f) use the Service unlawfully.</p>

  <h2>7. No Wagering or Gambling</h2>
  <p>PicksLeagues does not offer real‑money wagering, and the Service must not be used to facilitate gambling. Any odds or lines displayed are informational only.</p>

  <h2>8. Third‑Party Data and Links</h2>
  <p>Scores, schedules, teams, and odds may be provided by third‑party sources (e.g., ESPN). Such data may be delayed or inaccurate. We are not responsible for third‑party content, sites, or services.</p>

  <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The Service, including its software, logos, and content, is owned by PicksLeagues or its licensors and is protected by law. Team names, logos, and league marks are the property of their respective owners and do not imply endorsement.</p>

  <h2>10. Termination and Account Deletion</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms. You may request account deletion. When you delete your account, we anonymize your profile (e.g., username and email) and remove your memberships. If you are the sole commissioner of a league with other members, you must designate another commissioner before deletion.</p>

  <h2>11. Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement. Data (including scores and odds) may be incomplete or contain errors.</p>

  <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, PicksLeagues and its affiliates are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising from or related to your use of the Service.</p>

  <h2>13. Changes to the Service or Terms</h2>
  <p>We may modify the Service or these Terms at any time. Material changes will be posted in the app or on our site. Your continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of [your governing state/country]. The courts located in [your venue] shall have exclusive jurisdiction, unless otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
