  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: August 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We collect:
  </p>
  <p>
    • Account data: name, email, username, avatar, and basic profile details.<br/>
    • Auth/account provider data: provider IDs and tokens (e.g., for social login). We store only what is necessary to authenticate and manage sessions.<br/>
    • Session and device data: session tokens, IP address, user agent, and expiration.<br/>
    • App activity: league memberships, picks you submit, standings, and related timestamps.<br/>
    • Support and communications: messages you send to us.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also ingest sports data (teams, schedules, scores, odds) from third parties for display and scoring; this does not include your personal data.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>
    • Provide the Service: authenticate users, maintain sessions, manage leagues, lock picks at configured times, and compute standings.<br/>
    • Improve and secure the Service: monitor performance, detect abuse or fraud, and troubleshoot issues.<br/>
    • Communicate with you: account notices, feature updates, and support responses.<br/>
    • Legal compliance: enforce our Terms and comply with applicable laws.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    • Within leagues: your username, avatar, picks, and standings are visible to members of the same league.<br/>
    • Service providers: infrastructure, analytics, and email providers who process data under contract and only as instructed by us.<br/>
    • Legal and safety: when required by law or to protect rights, safety, and the integrity of the Service.<br/>
    • We do not sell personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third‑Party Sports Data</h2>
  <p>Scores, schedules, and odds may be provided by third‑party sources (e.g., ESPN). Such data may be delayed or contain inaccuracies; it is provided for informational purposes only.</p>

  <h2>5. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
  <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to keep you signed in, remember preferences, and measure usage. You can control cookies via your browser settings; disabling cookies may limit functionality.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain personal data while your account is active and as needed to provide the Service. If you request account deletion, we anonymize your profile (e.g., username and email) and remove your league memberships. Some minimal records may be retained for security, fraud prevention, or legal compliance.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Subject to applicable law, you may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data, and object to or restrict certain processing. To exercise rights, contact us at picksleagues@gmail.com.</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>10. International Users</h2>
  <p>If you access the Service from outside your country of residence, your data may be processed in jurisdictions where data protection laws differ. We take steps to protect your data consistent with this policy.</p>

  <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be posted in the app or on our site. Your continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>12. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, contact us at picksleagues@gmail.com.  </p>
